## Data Preprocessing

**Missing Value Tratment** 

As mentioned earlier, we identified **491 missing values** in key columns such as main_camera_mp, selfie_camera_mp, int_memory, ram, battery, and weight. To handle them, we applied group based imputation by grouping the data by brand_name and release_year, two columns without missing values. We used the median within each group to fill the missing values, as these columns contain outliers and the median is more robust than the mean. This method provides more accurate and context aware imputations compared to using a single global value.

**Feature Engineering**

We are going to create a new column, years_since_release, by calculating the difference between the current year (2021) and the release_year of the product, using 2021 as a reference year to avoid altering the analysis of the recorded years. This transformation is more useful than the original release_year because the product's age is often more relevant for predictive models. After creating years_since_release, we drop the release_year column to avoid redundancy.

  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9e6046-fb24-4c2c-be78-e31e168490d3" width="500"/>

variable insights: 

The majority of devices were released between 3 and 7 years ago, with a median age of around 5 years. The distribution is balanced and free of outliers, making it suitable for modeling resale trends, depreciation, and user preferences across different product ages.


**Outlier Check** 

There are several outliers present in the dataset. However, we decided not to treat them, as they reflect valid and realistic values rather than errors or anomalies. Removing these points could distort the natural distribution and compromise the integrity of the analysis.

## Model Building

**Data preparation** 

The data was preprocessed by encoding categorical variables, adding a constant for the intercept, and splitting it into 70% training and 30% test. This ensured the dataset was clean, numeric, and ready for Linear Regression modeling and evaluation.

--- 

## Linear Regression Model

The model explains over **80% of the variance** in the target variable and maintains low prediction error on both training and test sets, indicating strong generalization and no signs of overfitting. With a **MAE** of **20%**, it predicts normalized resale prices with minimal average deviation. Finally, a **MAPE** of **4.8%** confirms the modelâ€™s ability to estimate resale prices within a tight and practical margin, making it suitable for real world pricing strategies.

## Multicollinearity and Treat High P-values

To improve model stability and interpretability, I first addressed multicollinearity by calculating the VIF. The analysis revealed that some features such as screen_size, brand_name_Apple, and brand_name_Others had high multicollinearity, which could distort coefficient estimates. These variables were removed, reducing VIF scores across the remaining features to acceptable levels. Additionally, I refined the model by eliminating variables with **p-values greater than 0.05**, as they were not statistically significant. This two step feature selection process enhanced the modelâ€™s robustness and ensured that only meaningful predictors were retained.


---

## Final Linear Model 

The **Linear Regression** model explains **80%** of the variation in resale prices and predicts used device values with an average error of just **4.8%**. This makes it a reliable tool for estimating second-hand value and supporting smarter pricing decisions. Also, the model shows which aspects of a phone increase its resale value and which brands retain their value.
